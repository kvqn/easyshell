## Motivation

This is a follow-up to a previous problem, <ProblemLink slug="grep-version" /> which covered very basic `grep` usage. This problem expands on that and adds a few other regex tricks to the mix.

The objective was to challenge the user in the following ways:

- Basics of command chaining
- Basics of `find`
- Basic `grep` options
- Regex (lookaheads & lookbehinds)

## Solution

The problem can be divided into the following steps:

1. Finding `__about__.py`
2. Reading the contents of `__about__.py`
3. Extracting the version string

The first two steps are identical to the previous problem. Please refer to <WikiLink slug="grep-version" /> for more details.

### Step 3: Extracting the version string
