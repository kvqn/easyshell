## Motivation

The problem asks you to find a particular file and extract a string from it. Parsing the output of a command is a fairly common task that you will find yourself doing very often when you primarily use the command line.

The objective was to challenge the user in the following ways:

- Basics of command chaining
- Basics of `find`
- Basics of regex and `grep`

## Solution

The problem can be divided into the following steps:

1. Finding `__about__.py`
2. Reading the contents of `__about__.py`
3. Extracting the version string

### Step 1: Finding `__about__.py`

The first step is trivial. Any of the following strategies will work:

Using `find` with the `-name` option

```bash
find . -name __about__.py
```

Using `find` with `grep`. Although this is not the most efficient way to do it, it is a good exercise in using `grep`.

```bash
find . | grep '\/__about__.py$'
```

### Step 2: Reading the contents of `__about__.py`

This isn't so much as just reading the contents, but passing the contents to grep.

This is usually done in one of two ways.

Using `cat` to read the file and then piping it to `grep`

```bash
cat "$(find <options>)" | grep <options>
```

> Notice the use of `"` around the `find` command. This is important because it allows the shell to interpret the output of the `find` command as a single argument, even if it contains spaces or special characters.

Passing the file path to `grep` directly

```bash
grep <options> "$(find <options>)"
```

### Step 3: Extracting the version string

This is the real meat of the problem. Let's refer to the problem constraints

> The version will always be defined in the format `__version__ = "X.Y.Z"` (X, Y, Z are numeric values which can be of different length)

and

> There are no other variables or strings in the file that match this pattern.

We can use a simple regex to extract the version string.

- `\d` would match any digit.
- `\d+` would match one or more digits.
- `\.` would match a literal dot.

So the final regex we use is `\d+\.\d+\.\d+`

> Note: This would not work if there are other variables or strings in the file that match this pattern. In that case, we would need to use a more complex regex to match the version string.

We will also make use of the following options for `grep`:

- `-o` show only the matching string (it would show the entire line otherwise)
- `-P` use Perl-compatible regex (PCRE) which allows us to use the `\d` shorthand for digits. (You will almost always require this flag when dealing with even slightly complex regex patterns)

Hence the `grep` command would look something like this

```bash
grep -oP '\d+\.\d+\.\d+'
```

You would use this in conjunction with the previous commands.

### Final Command

The final command would look something like this

```bash
find . -name __about__.py | grep -oP '\d+\.\d+\.\d+'
```
