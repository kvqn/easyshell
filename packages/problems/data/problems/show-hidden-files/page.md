# Problem Statement

Ever wondered what secrets your directory is hiding? In Unix-like systems, files and folders that start with a dot (.) are hidden by default. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to expose all these undercover files and folders lurking in your current directory. No more secrets!

# Instructions

1. List all hidden files and hidden folders (those starting with a dot) in the current directory.
2. Make sure your command reveals the entire contents (recursively) of every hidden folder in the current directory, not just their names.
3. Sort the output in alphabetical order.
