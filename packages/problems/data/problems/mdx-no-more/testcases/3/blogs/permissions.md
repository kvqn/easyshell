# Mastering File Permissions in Linux

Permissions are how Linux keeps your files safe from nosy neighbors (and yourself).

## Permission Basics

- **r**: Read (look but don’t touch).
- **w**: Write (make changes).
- **x**: Execute (run it like a program).

Use `chmod` to change permissions, and `ls -l` to see them in action.

Pro Tip: Use octal notation (`chmod 755`) for faster permission changes—it’s geeky but efficient!
