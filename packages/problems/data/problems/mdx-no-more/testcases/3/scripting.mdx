## Tips for Better Scripts

1. Always start with a shebang (`#!/bin/bash`). It’s like saying “Hey, I’m a script!”
1. Use comments (`#`) generously—future-you will thank you later.
1. Test scripts on sample data before running them on important files.

Pro Tip: Modularize your script by using functions—it makes debugging easier.
