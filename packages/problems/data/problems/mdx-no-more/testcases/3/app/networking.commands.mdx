## Networking Essentials

1. `ping`: Check if a server is alive (or just ignoring you).
1. `curl`: Fetch data from URLs—because browsers are overrated.
1. `ifconfig` or `ip addr`: Inspect your network interfaces like a pro.
1. `netstat`: See who’s talking to your machine over the network.

Pro Tip: Use `traceroute` to follow the path your packets take—it’s like GPS for data.
