Your computer is always busy, but with Linux, you’re the boss of all processes.

## Essential Process Commands

- `top`: Spy on your system's activity in real-time.
- `kill`: Politely (or not-so-politely) ask a process to stop.
- `jobs`: Keep track of background tasks like a multitasking pro.
- `bg` and `fg`: Move jobs between the background and foreground effortlessly.

Fun Fact: The PID (Process ID) is like your process’s social security number.
