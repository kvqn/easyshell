# File Operations in Linux

Files are the heart of any operating system, and Linux gives you superpowers to manage them.

## Key Commands for File Operations

- `touch`: Create an empty file faster than you can say "new file."
- `mv`: Move or rename files like a ninja.
- `cp`: Copy filesâ€”because backups are your best friend.
- `rm`: Delete files... but remember, with great power comes great responsibility.

Pro Tip: Always use `ls` before running `rm` to avoid accidental disasters!
