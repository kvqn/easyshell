# Problem Statement

Log files are **all over the place**, making things hard to track. Your task is to **find all `.log` files** in the directory tree and move them into a **single folder named `logs/`**, without disturbing any other files.

# Instructions

1. Locate **all files ending in `.log`** anywhere in the directory tree.
2. Move them to a **folder named `logs/`**.
3. If `logs/` **does not exist**, create it before moving the files.
4. Leave all other files and folders **untouched**.

> Note: You can assume there will be no collisions in filenames.
