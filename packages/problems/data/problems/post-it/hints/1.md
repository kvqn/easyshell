Just like the previous problem, you can use `curl` to make the request. To make a post request, you need to add the `-XPOST` option and to pass the JSON object, you need to add the `-d` option. Here's an example of how you can make a post request using `curl`:

```bash
curl -XPOST http://localhost:4000/new-post -d '{"content": "I love easyshell.sh", "author": "literally everyone"}'
```
