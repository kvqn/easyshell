You can make use of `jq` to parse the JSON response by piping the output to `jq`. Here's an example of how you can do that:

```bash
echo '
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30
}
' | jq '.age'
```

This command will output the following

```stdout
30
```

Since there are no quotes around the output of numbers, you don't need to pass flags for raw output.
