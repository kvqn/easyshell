# Problem Statement

In the shell, files are everywhere, and sometimes you just need to take a peek inside. Your task is to **display the contents of a given file** in the terminal. This is one of the most common things you'll do when working with the command line—whether you're checking logs, reading scripts, or debugging a program.

# Instructions

1. You will be given a file named `notes.txt`.
2. Use a shell command to display the contents of this file in the terminal.
3. Ensure that the output matches the file’s contents exactly.
