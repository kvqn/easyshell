Now that you have the file content, time to extract the version. You can use `grep` for this task.
The `grep` command can be used to search for the version pattern of `X.Y.Z`.

```
<read the file> | grep -oP '\d+\.\d+\.\d+'
```

Explanation -

- `\d` matches any digit
- `\d+` matches one or more digit
- `\.` matches the literal `.`

- `-o` prints only the matched part of the line
- `-P` enables perl-compatible regular expressions (needed for advanced regex)
