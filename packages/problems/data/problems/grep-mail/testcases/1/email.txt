Subject: Attendee List - Networking Event (Confidential)

Hey Boss,

I managed to get my hands on the attendee list from last night’s networking event. Let’s just say a little “incentive” helped grease the wheels. Below is the list of attendees and some basic information about them. Their email addresses are embedded in the text—you’ll find everything you need to start "encouraging" them for investments.

Cheers,
Your Guy
