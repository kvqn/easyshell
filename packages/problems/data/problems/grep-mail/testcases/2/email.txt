Subject: More Leads from the Networking Event

Boss,

Remember that first list I sent over? Well, our “source” at the event had even more valuable intel. After a little extra persuasion (you know how it goes), I managed to get another batch of attendee details. This group is just as promising as the first—some heavy hitters here who might be open to a little nudge from you. Their emails are embedded in the text below.
