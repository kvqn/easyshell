# Problem Statement

Your boss just handed you a mysterious file with a grin on his face. Apparently, this file contains email addresses of potential investors and clients. He wants you to extract all the email addresses so he can "gently encourage" them for their support (we all know what that means). You ask him where he got his hands on this file, but he just winks and says, "Don't worry about it" and walks away.

# Instructions

1. The file is named `email.txt`.
2. Read the file's contents and extract all email addresses.
3. Remove any duplicates and print the emails in a sorted order.
