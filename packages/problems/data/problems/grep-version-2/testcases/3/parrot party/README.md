# parrotparty

Welcome to **parrotparty**, the only Python package that never stops repeating itself!

This README was generated by an AI who wishes it could fly, or at least squawk convincingly.

## Features

- Repeat any string as many times as you want
- Randomly mimic your code comments (sometimes better than the originals)
- Built-in support for party mode (confetti not included)
