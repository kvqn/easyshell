You can use jq to extract specific fields from JSON data. For example, to extract the id field from a JSON object:

```bash
echo '{"id": 42, "title": "My First Post"}' | jq '.id'
```

The `|` operator pipes the output of the first command into the second command, allowing you to chain commands together.
