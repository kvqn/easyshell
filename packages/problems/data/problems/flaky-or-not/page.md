# Problem Statement

You’ve stumbled upon a wild shell script called flaky-command.sh. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t—classic flaky behavior! Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to run this script and boldly announce to the world (well, your terminal) if it succeeded or failed. Are you lucky today?

# Instructions

1. Run the script flaky-command.sh in your shell.

2. If the script runs successfully, print Passed.

3. If the script fails, print Failed.

4. Redirect the output of the script to `/dev/null` to avoid cluttering your terminal with its output.
