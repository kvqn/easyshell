# Problem Statement

Files don’t always belong where they start. Your task is to **move a single file** from a **source directory** to a **destination directory**. Keep the filename the same—just relocate it!

# Instructions

1. You will be given a **file named `payload.json`**.
2. Move this file to a **folder named `datadir/`**.
3. The filename **must remain `payload.json`** after the move.
4. If the `datadir/` folder **does not exist**, create it before moving the file.
