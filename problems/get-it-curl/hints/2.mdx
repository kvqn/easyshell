You can use the `jq` tool to parse JSON. Here's an example

```bash
echo '
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30
}
' | jq '.name'
```

This command will output the following

```stdout
"John Doe"
```

You can remove the quotes by using the `-r` option to get the raw output.

There is also the `-j` option which removes the quotes as well as the trailing newline character. This is useful while scripting.
