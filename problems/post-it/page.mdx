# Problem Statement

Good job on fetching the most recent post! Now, let's make a post of our own.

# Instructions

1. Make a `POST` request on `http://localhost:4000` at the `/new-post` route.
2. The post body should be a JSON object as such:

```json
{
  "content": "Easyshell is a great platform",
  "author": "Alice"
}
```

3. The server will respond with a response as such:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Post created successfully",
  "post_id": 1251
}
```

4. Display the `post_id` in the shell. As such

```stdout
1251
```

> Note: make only one post, your output should the output of the first post you make.
