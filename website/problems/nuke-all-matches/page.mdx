# Problem Statement

Oops! Once you deleted the `logs/` folder your boss yelled at you for deleting files that weren't logs. Good thing you had that backup.

After this incident, you revise your strategy and decide to delete only the `.log` files. You know that the `.log` files are scattered all over the place, so you need to find them and delete them.

# Instructions

1. Search for **all** files with the `.log` extension.
2. **Remove them permanently**, leaving everything else untouched.
3. Be preciseâ€”**only** delete `.log` files, not other file types.
4. Make sure no `.log` files remain after the operation.
