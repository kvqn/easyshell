# Problem Statement

Welcome to your first shell command! ðŸŽ‰

Your task is simple: print **"Hello, World!"** to the terminal. This might seem basic, but itâ€™s a tradition in programmingâ€”almost every language starts with this as a first exercise. In the shell, printing text is a fundamental skill that serves as the foundation for scripting, automation, and system interaction.

# Sample Output

```stdout
Hello, World!
```
